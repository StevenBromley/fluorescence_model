The code contained in this repo is the same version used in Bromley et al 2021 in PSJ (see also arxiv): "Atomic iron and nickel in the coma of C/1996 B2 (Hyakutake): production rates, emissionmechanisms, and possible parents"
The theoretical background is described in Bromley et al 2021, and the code is distributed under a GNU GPL license. If you intend to modify this code, please
contact me with any questions.

The code is built to use atomic data from the NIST ASD:
https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html

The lines and levels files are generated by quering the NIST ASD for lines (only those with transition rates), and energies in units of cm^-1. When the lines/levels pages are loaded as Tab-Delimited, simply right click and "Save As" your preferred naming convention. The names of these files are used in the script and passed into a custom data-loading function (see example script, described below).

A sample file, "ni0 example script.py" shows the syntax and order of function calls. This sample script will general g-factors for neutral nickel at 1 AU (heliocentric velocity = 0 km/s).

The syntax for performing Monte-Carlo iterations to generate approximate model uncertainties with 10 iterations is provided. Note that 10^4 or more iterations
are required for good convergence.

The solar spectrum assumed in the model, the default "0-2730_vac.txt" file, contains the following:
0 - 168 nm: The UV coronol/chromosphere model of Fontenla et al (2014) [1]. This spectrum shows good agreement with measurements of the quiet sun spectrum from the SORCE mission.
168 - 200.06 nm: SOLSTICE quiet-sun measurements with 0.1 nm resolution
200.06 - 202 nm: Hall and Anderson (1991) UV measurements [2]
 202 - 2730 nm: Composite high-resolution benchmarked solar spectrum from Coddington et al (2021). Their dataset is compiled
          from various space- and ground-based measurements of the solar spectrum, including the famous measurements of Kurucz.
          
The code is currently capable of assuming two line profiles when computing absorption/stimulated emission rates: a delta function, and a doppler (thermal) profile.
