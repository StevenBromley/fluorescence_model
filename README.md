# fluorescence_model

The model code is contained in "fluor_v4.py"
The test script for Ni will generate synthetic spectra at 1.02 AU for a comet traveling at -36.5 km/s w.r.t. the sun

To run the model, do the following:

1. Download all files in this github repository,
2. The code requires a Kurucz solar spectra; to acquire this, go to:

http://kurucz.harvard.edu/stars/sun/

and download the file marked: fsunallp.100000resam3   13-Apr-2011 12:03   46M  
The test script requires this file be saved as 'kurucz_solar_spectra.txt'

3. With all of the files in the same directory, run the Ni python script.
